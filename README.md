## Course Projects

The Buzz on Colony Loss: What Colony Numbers Tell Us About Loss Percentages üêù

- Project can be found at [here](https://cailey-plainte.github.io/STAT228_portfolio/2025/03/11/Colony-Loss.html)
- Explored the relationship between colony size and average percentage of colony loss using R. 

Plastic Pollution: A Data Wrangling Tutorial üåé

- Project can be found [here](https://cailey-plainte.github.io/STAT228_portfolio/2025/04/11/Plastics.html)
- An exploration of data wrangling techniques in a tutorial format, including exercises and answers for the reader to follow along with

Fueling the Footprint: Exploring How Parent Entity and Commoditiy Types Impact Carbon Emissions üè≠
- Project can be found [here](https://cailey-plainte.github.io/STAT228_portfolio/2025/05/06/Fueling-The-Footprint.html)
- Presentation can be found [here](https://cailey-plainte.github.io/STAT228_portfolio/Copy%20of%20Minimalist%20Green%20Slides%20Infographics%20by%20Slidesgo.pdf)
- This project explored the relationship between parent entity type, commodity produced, and carbon emissions
- A classification decision tree was developed to predict if a certain annual carbon emissions report would be classified as above or below the average emissions amount for that year
- It was determined that, while these factors produce predictive results that are better than random guessing, the addition of more factors would be needed to create a more reliable model
